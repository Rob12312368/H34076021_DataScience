# H34076021_DataScience
This repository includes all the homework file completed during the DataScience class. I have implemented several machine learning algorithms in python from scratch, such as kmeans, knn, dbscan, and decision tree ( **please see all the ipynb file in HW** ). In addition, I cooperated with another classmate to complete several projects. For more reference, please visit my personal webpage: https://rob12312368.github.io/Rob.github.io/machine_learning.html

Please note that I no longer update this webpage, and some of the pages may not have any content.
